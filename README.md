# C-Programming

What is C Language?
C programming language, the pioneer of programming languages, is a procedural programming language. Dennis Ritchie created it as a system programming language for writing operating systems. It is one of the most popular programming languages because of its structure, high-level abstraction, machine-independent feature, etc. and is a great starting point for anyone wanting to get into coding. 

C is also used a lot in low-level system programming, embedded systems, and hardware. It has also been heavily optimized over the years and is still used to write sophisticated software such as the FreeBSD operating system and the XNU kernel. Low-level memory access, a small collection of keywords, and a clean style are all qualities that make the C language excellent for system programmings, such as operating system or compiler development. 

C is a low-level programming language that can be directly interfaced with the processor. It offers minimal abstraction and maximal control, making it an attractive option for developers who want to write efficient code. 

C Basic Interview Questions
1. Why is C called a mid-level programming language?
C has characteristics of both assembly-level i.e. low-level and higher-level languages. So as a result, C is commonly called a middle-level language. Using C, a user can write an operating system as well as create a menu-driven consumer billing system.

2. What are the features of the C language?
Some features of the C language are- 

It is Simple And Efficient. 
C language is portable or Machine Independent.
C is a mid-level Programming Language. 
It is a structured Programming Language.
It has a function-rich library. 
Dynamic Memory Management.
C is super fast.
We can use pointers in C.
It is extensible.
3. What is a token?
The individual elements of a program are called Tokens. There are following 6 types of tokens are available in C:

Identifiers
Keywords
Constants
Operators
Special Characters
Strings
